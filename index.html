This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading books keep one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction.

Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour An Old Man is happy today he doesnt complain about anything smiles and even his face is freshened up.The whole village gathered together. The old man was asked:Village What happened to you Nothing special. Eighty years Ive been chasing happiness  and it was useless. And then I decided to live without happiness and just enjoy life. That is why I m happy now. An Old Man.Moral of the story Dont chase happiness. Enjoy your life.
